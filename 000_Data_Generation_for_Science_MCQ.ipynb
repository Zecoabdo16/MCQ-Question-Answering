Genomes are circular and non-segmented, around 3.0kb in length.Life cycleViral replication is nuclear. Entry into the host cell is achieved by penetration into the host cell. Replication follows the ssDNA rolling circle model. DNA-templated transcription is the method of transcription. The virus exits the host cell by nuclear pore export, and tubule-guided viral movement. Dicotyledonous plants serve as the natural host.ReferencesExternal links Viralzone: Becurtovirus ICTVGeminiviridaeVirus genera Cyprinivirus is a genus of viruses in the order Herpesvirales, in the family Alloherpesviridae. Freshwater eels serve as natural hosts. There are four species in this genus. Diseases associated with this genus include: hemorrhagic disease.Species The genus consists of the following four species: Anguillid herpesvirus 1 Cyprinid herpesvirus 1 Cyprinid herpesvirus 2 Cyprinid herpesvirus 3Structure Viruses in Cyprinivirus are enveloped, with icosahedral and spherical to pleomorphic geometries, and T=16 symmetry. The diameter is around 200nm. Genomes are linear and non-segmented, around 10kb in length. The genome codes for 136 proteins.Life cycle Viral replication is nuclear, and is lysogenic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the viral glycoproteins to host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. DNA-templated transcription is the method of transcription. Freshwater eel serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are passive diffusion.ReferencesExternal links Viralzone: Cyprinivirus ICTVAlloherpesviridaeVirus genera Glossinavirus is a genus of viruses, in the family Hytrosaviridae. Glossina sp serve as natural hosts. There is only one species in this genus: Glossina hytrosavirus. Diseases associated with this genus include: partial sterility due to ovarian abnormalities or to testicular degeneration; can be asymptomatic in laboratory colonies.StructureViruses in the genus Glossinavirus are enveloped, with rod-shaped geometries. The diameter is around 50nm. Genomes are circular, around 190kb in length. The genome has 160 open reading frames.Life cycleViral replication is nuclear. DNA-templated transcription is the method of transcription. Glossina species serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are parental.ReferencesExternal links ICTV Report: Hytrosaviridae Viralzone: GlossinavirusHytrosaviridaeVirus genera Ichtadenovirus is a genus of viruses, in the family Adenoviridae. Fish serve as natural hosts. There is only one species in this genus: Sturgeon ichtadenovirus A.StructureViruses in Ichtadenovirus are non-enveloped, with icosahedral geometries, and T=25 symmetry. The diameter is around 90nm. Genomes are linear and non-segmented, around 35-36kb in length. The genome codes for 40 proteins.Life cycleViral replication is nuclear. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the viral fiber glycoproteins to host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. Replication follows the DNA strand displacement model. DNA-templated transcription, with some alternative splicing mechanism is the method of transcription. The virus exits the host cell by nuclear envelope breakdown, viroporins, and lysis.
